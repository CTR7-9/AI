# Prompt Caching — Design & Optimization

This file covers how to design prompt-building code for effective caching. For language-specific syntax, see the `## Prompt Caching` section in each language's README or single-file doc.

## The one invariant everything follows from

**Prompt caching is a prefix match. Any change anywhere in the prefix invalidates everything after it.**

The cache key is derived from the exact bytes of the rendered prompt up to each `cache_control` breakpoint. A single byte difference at position N — a timestamp, a reordered JSON key, a different tool in the list — invalidates the cache for all breakpoints at positions ≥ N.
