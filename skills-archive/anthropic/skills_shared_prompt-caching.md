# Prompt Caching — Design & Optimization

This file covers how to design prompt-building code for effective caching. For language-specific syntax, see the `## Prompt Caching` section in each language's README or single-file doc.

## The one invariant everything follows from

**Prompt caching is a prefix match. Any change anywhere in the prefix invalidates everything after it.**

The cache key is derived from the exact bytes of the rendered prompt up to each `cache_control` breakpoint. A single byte difference at position N — a timestamp, a reordered JSON key, a different tool in the list — invalidates the cache for all breakpoints at positions ≥ N.

Render order is: `tools` → `system` → `messages`. A breakpoint on the last system block caches both tools and system together.

Design the prompt-building path around this constraint. Get the ordering right and most caching works for free. Get it wrong and no amount of `cache_control` markers will help.

## Workflow for optimizing existing code

When asked to add or optimize caching:

1. **Trace the prompt assembly path.** Find where `system`, `tools`, and `messages` are constructed. Identify every input that flows into them.
2. **Classify each input by stability:**
   - Never changes → belongs early in the prompt, before any breakpoint
   - Changes per-session → belongs after the global prefix, cache per-session
   - Changes per-turn → belongs at the end, after the last breakpoint
   - Changes per-request (timestamps, UUIDs, random IDs) → **eliminate or move to the very end**

```
